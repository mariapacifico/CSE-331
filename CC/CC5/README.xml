        Per usual, my struggle is always figuring out how to get the correct run time. My first submission
        showed me sort of just submitting something for the sake of submitting something that had a very high
        run time. I'm very glad that I attended class today for Onsay to explain why using a min heap was the best
        decision. It really cut the run time and made things click. I did draw it out as she did as well but I was
        wasn't able to come to that way without her walking through it in class today.
